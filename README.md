## Testing

The website was developed and thought for three major screen sizes: Phones -max 599px; Tablet -min 600px; Laptops and Desktops- min 992px.

It was tested using the inspect feature of the chrome browser and my actual phone and tablet.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - While passing through the validator, it pointed for a lack of header for the <section> but it has a header right on top of it. And also it didn't like how I setted the width to '30px' which make no sense. [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fluispierro.github.io%2FProject1-codeinstitute%2F)
